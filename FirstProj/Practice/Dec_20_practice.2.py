# Write a function called fizz_buzz that takes a number.
#  If the number is divisible by 3, it should return “Fizz”.
# If it is divisible by 5, it should return “Buzz”.
# If it is divisible by both 3 and 5, it should return “FizzBuzz”.
# Otherwise, it should return the same number

        return "Fizz"
    elif number % 5 == 0:
        return "Buzz"
    else:
